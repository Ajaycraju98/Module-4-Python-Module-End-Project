# Module-4-Python-Module-End-Project
This project explains about the  Python programming and Creating visualizations to understand the key insights 
# About the Project
The given dataset from ABC Company consists of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about its employees across various teams. 

# Step 1: Preprocessing the Dataset
The dataset contains 458 rows and 9 columns.
A total of 95 null values were found in the "college" and "salary" columns using the isnull() function. These missing values were replaced with zero.
The "height" column was populated with random numbers between 150 and 180 using random.randint().

# Step 2: Analyzing the Dataset
The analysis focuses on the following key aspects:

1.Percentage-wise distribution of employees across different teams.

2.Position-wise distribution of employees based on their roles.

3.Identification of the most prevalent age group among employees.

4.Determining the team with the highest salary expenditure.

5.Understanding the relationship between age and salary of employees.

# Step 3: Graphical Representations 
The findings are presented using various visualization techniques:

1.Pie Chart – Displays the employee distribution across teams.

2.Bar Chart – Represents employee distribution by position.

3.Histogram – Shows the distribution of employees by age group.

4.Line Chart – Illustrates salary expenditure by team and position.

5.Scatter Plot – Visualizes the correlation between age and salary.

# Key Trends Observed 
1.The New Orleans Pelicans have the highest number of employees.

2.Shooting Guard (SG) is the most common position among employees.

3.Employees aged 26-30 are the most prevalent in the dataset.

4.Cleveland Cavaliers spend the most on salaries among teams, while Centers (C) receive the highest salaries among positions.

5.There is a slight positive correlation between age and salary, suggesting that salaries tend to increase with age, but not significantly.


# Additional Insights
1. Team Roster Strategy
Since the New Orleans Pelicans have the highest number of employees, they might have a larger roster, possibly due to frequent rotations, a strong player development program, or an injury-prone squad.

2. Positional Demand & Team Composition
The high occurrence of Shooting Guards (SGs) suggests that teams prioritize guards for offensive playmaking and scoring.

3. Age & Career Lifecycle
The dominance of the 26-30 age group indicates that this is the prime playing age in the league.
Younger players may still be developing, while older players could be transitioning toward retirement or experiencing performance declines due to injuries.

4. Salary Insights & Market Trends
The Cleveland Cavaliers spend the most on salaries, so it’s important to analyze whether this investment translates into on-court success (e.g., championship wins, playoff appearances).
Centers (C) receive the highest salaries, showing that dominant big men are still highly valued for rebounding, defense, and inside scoring. Comparing their impact to guards and forwards could provide deeper insights.

5. Age vs. Salary Correlation
The slight positive correlation between age and salary suggests that experience is rewarded, but not excessively.
Teams might be cautious about offering long-term, high-value contracts to older players due to injury risks or declining performance.
