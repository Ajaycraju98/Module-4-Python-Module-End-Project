# Module-4-Python-Module-End-Project
This project explains about the  Python programming and Creating visualizations to understand the key insights 
About the project:
The given dataset from ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. 
The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. 
Your tasks include preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting your findings graphically. 

# step 1:Pre processing the dataset:
The given data set having the 458 rows and 9  columns .in the dataset 95 null values are found in the "college" and "salary" columns using isnull() function and replaced with zero values .also height column is replaced with random numbers between 150 to 180 using random.randint.
# step 2:Analysing the dataset:
1.To find the percentage wise distribution of the employees based on the teams 
2.To understand the position wise distribution of the employees based on the position
3.To understand the most prevalend age group of employees .
4.To understand the highest salary expenditure with the "team and "salary" of the given employees.
5.To understand the relationship between age and salary of the employees.

# Step 3:Visulizations or Graphical representations 
1.Using Pie chart for shwoing the Employee Distribution Across Teams.
2.Using Bar chart for showing the Employee Distribution by position.
3.Using Histogram for showing the Employee Distribution by Age group.
4.Using line chart for showing the Salary Expenditure BY Team and Position
5.Using Scatter plot for showing the Correlation between and Age and Salary of employees.


<!-- # Key Trends Observed --> -->
1.The majority of employees are in the New Orleans Pelicans team.
2.SG (Shooting Guard) is the most common position among employees.
3.Employees in the 26-30 age group are the most prevalent.
4.Cleveland Cavaliers spend the most on salaries among teams, while Centers (C) receive the highest salaries among positions.
5.There is a slight positive correlation between age and salary, suggesting that salaries tend to increase with age, but not strongly.
